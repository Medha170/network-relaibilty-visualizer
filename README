## 🧪 Local Setup

Clone and run the project locally:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Medha170/network-reliablity-visualizer.git
cd graph-visualizer
```

### Client Setup

```bash
# 2. Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install

# 3. Start the React app
npm run dev
```

### Server Setup

```bash
# 4. In another terminal, run the backend server
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```

## 🧠 Core Algorithms

Located in `graphUtils.js`:

* 🔍 **Tarjan’s Algorithm** – For finding articulation points
* 🌉 **DFS-based Bridge Detection** – Identifies critical connections

These are exposed via the `/api/analyze-graph` API endpoint.
